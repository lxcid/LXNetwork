    // If you're not familiar with Swift, the mutation semantics here may seem like a very big red
    // flag, destroying the purity of this type. In fact, because states have *value semantics*,
    // mutation becomes mere syntax sugar. From a semantic perspective, any call to this method
    // creates a new instance of StateType; no code other than the caller has visibility to the
    // change; the normal perils of mutability do not apply.
    //
    // If this is confusing, keep in mind that we could equivalently define this as a function
    // which returns both a new state value and an optional OutputCommand (it just creates some
    // line noise later):
    func handleEvent(event: InputEvent) -> (Self, OutputCommand)?
    
    /// State machines must specify an initial value.
    static var initialState: Self { get }
    
    // Traditional models often allow states to specific commands to be performed on entry or
    // exit. We could add that, or not.
